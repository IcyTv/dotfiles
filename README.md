# IcyTv's dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles.
I use [rotz](https://github.com/volllly/rotz) to manage the dotfiles.

## Getting started

To use this repo, install rotz and run:

```bash
rotz clone git@github.com/IcyTv/dotfiles.git
```

## Usage

To bootstrap the environment, run:

```bash
rotz install
rotz link
```

## Contribute

This probably will not work on every system, as I am currently only using Arch and Windows.
If you want to make it work, just open an issue or a pull request and I will try to help you.
